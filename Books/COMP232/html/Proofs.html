<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>4.7.1. Mathematical Proof Techniques<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Solving any problem has two distinct parts:
the investigation and the argument.
Students are too used to seeing only the argument in their textbooks
and lectures.
But to be successful in school (and in life after school),
one needs to be good at both, and to understand the differences
between these two phases of the process.
To solve the problem, you must investigate successfully.
That means engaging the problem, and working through until you find a
solution.
Then, to give the answer to your client (whether that &quot;client&quot; be
your instructor when writing answers on a homework assignment or exam,
or a written report to your boss),
you need to be able to make the argument in a way
that gets the solution across clearly and succinctly.
The argument phase involves good technical writing skills—the ability to make a clear, logical argument.</p>
<p>Being conversant with standard proof techniques can help you in this
process.
Knowing how to write a good proof helps in many ways.
First, it clarifies your thought process, which in turn clarifies your
explanations.
Second, if you use one of the standard proof structures such as proof
by contradiction or an induction proof, then both you and your reader
are working from a shared understanding of that structure.
That makes for less complexity to your reader to understand your
proof, because the reader need not decode the structure of your
argument from scratch.</p>
<p>This section briefly introduces three commonly used proof techniques:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>deduction, or direct proof;</li>
<li>proof by contradiction and</li>
<li>proof by mathematical induction.</li>
</ol>
<p id="index-1">In general, a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-direct-proof"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">direct proof</em></a> is just a &quot;logical explanation&quot;.
A direct proof is sometimes referred to as an argument by deduction.
This is simply an argument in terms of logic.</p>
<div class="section" id="direct-proof">
<h3>4.7.1.1. Direct Proof<a class="headerlink" href="#direct-proof" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="topic" id="sumdirect">
<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.1 </p>
<p>Here is a direct proof that <span class="math">\(\sum_{i=1}^n i = (n+1)n/2\)</span>.
If we take the first and last terms of the series, since they are 1
and <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, of course they sum to <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>.
If we take the second term and next-to-last term, since they are 2
and <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>, they also sum to <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>.
Likewise for the third term and third-from-the-end term.
We can go on and pair up terms like this, such that there are
<span class="math">\(n/2\)</span> pairs that each sum to <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>, for a total sum of
<span class="math">\((n+1)n/2\)</span>.
You can check for yourself that this is true even if <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is
odd (and so the middle value of the series has no partner).</p>
</div>
<p>Many direct proofs are written in English with words such as
&quot;if ... then&quot;.
In this case logic notation such as <span class="math">\(P \Rightarrow Q\)</span> can often
help express the proof.
Even if we don't wish to use symbolic logic notation, we can still
take advantage of fundamental theorems of logic to structure our
arguments.
For example, if we want to prove that <span class="math">\(P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Q\)</span> are
equivalent, we can first prove <span class="math">\(P \Rightarrow Q\)</span> and then prove
<span class="math">\(Q \Rightarrow P\)</span>.</p>
<p>In some domains, proofs are essentially a series of state changes from
a start state to an end state.
Formal predicate logic can be viewed in this way, with the various
&quot;rules of logic&quot; being used to make the changes from one formula or
combining a couple of formulas to make a new formula
on the route to the destination.
Symbolic manipulations to solve integration problems in introductory
calculus classes are similar in spirit, as are high school geometry
proofs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proof-by-contradiction">
<span id="index-2"></span><h3>4.7.1.2. Proof by Contradiction<a class="headerlink" href="#proof-by-contradiction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The simplest way to <em>disprove</em> a theorem or statement is to find
a counter-example to the theorem.
Unfortunately, no number of examples supporting a theorem is
sufficient to prove that the theorem is correct.
However, there is an approach that is vaguely similar to disproving by
counter-example, called <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-proof-by-contradiction"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">proof by contradiction</em></a>.
To prove a theorem by contradiction, we first <em>assume</em> that the
theorem is <em>false</em>.
We then find a logical contradiction stemming from this assumption.
If the logic used to find the contradiction is correct, then the only
way to resolve the contradiction is to recognize that the assumption
that the theorem is false must be incorrect.
That is, we conclude that the theorem must be true.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.2 </p>
<p>Here is a simple proof by contradiction.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> There is no largest integer.</p>
<p><strong>Proof by contradiction:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Contrary assumption:</strong> Assume that there <em>is</em> a
largest integer.
Call it <span class="math">\(B\)</span> (for &quot;biggest&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Show this assumption leads to a contradiction:</strong>
Consider <span class="math">\(C = B + 1\)</span>.
<span class="math">\(C\)</span> is an integer because it is the sum of two integers.
Also, <span class="math">\(C &gt; B\)</span>, which means that <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is not the
largest integer after all.
Thus, we have reached a contradiction.
The only flaw in our reasoning is the initial assumption that
the theorem is false.
Thus, we conclude that the theorem is correct.</p>
</div>
<p>A related proof technique is <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-proving-the-contrapositive"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">proving the contrapositive</em></a>.
We can prove that <span class="math">\(P \Rightarrow Q\)</span> by proving
<span class="math">\((\mathrm{not}\ Q) \Rightarrow (\mathrm{not}\ P)\)</span>.
This technique works because the <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-truth-table"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">truth table</em></a> for the two
logical statements are the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proof-by-mathematical-induction">
<span id="index-3"></span><h3>4.7.1.3. Proof by Mathematical Induction<a class="headerlink" href="#proof-by-mathematical-induction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mathematical induction can be used to prove a wide variety of
theorems.
Induction also provides a useful way to think about algorithm design,
because it encourages you to think about solving a problem by building
up from simple subproblems.
Induction can help to prove that a recursive function produces the
correct result.
Understanding recursion is a big step toward understanding induction,
and vice versa, since they work by essentially the same process.</p>
<p>Within the context of algorithm analysis, one of the most important
uses for mathematical induction is as a method to test a hypothesis.
When <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-closed-form-solution"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">seeking a closed-form solution</em></a>
for a <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-summation"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">summation</em></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-recurrence-relation"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">recurrence</em></a>,
we might first guess or otherwise acquire evidence that a particular
formula is the correct solution.
If the formula is indeed correct, it is often an easy matter to prove
that fact with an induction proof.</p>
<p>Let <strong>Thrm</strong> be a theorem to prove, and express <strong>Thrm</strong> in
terms of a positive integer parameter <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
Mathematical induction states that <strong>Thrm</strong> is true for any value
of parameter <span class="math">\(n\)</span> (for <span class="math">\(n \geq c\)</span>, where <cite>c</cite> is some
constant) if the following two conditions are true:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-base-case"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">Base Case</em></a>: <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for <span class="math">\(n = c\)</span>, and</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-induction-step"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">Induction Step</em></a>:
If <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for <span class="math">\(n - 1\)</span>, then <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Proving the base case is usually easy, typically requiring that some
small value such as 1 be substituted for <span class="math">\(n\)</span> in the theorem and
applying simple algebra or logic as necessary to verify the theorem.
Proving the induction step is sometimes easy, and sometimes difficult.
An alternative formulation of the induction step is known as
<a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-strong-induction"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">strong induction</em></a>.
The induction step for strong induction is:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>2a. <strong>Induction Step:</strong></dt>
<dd>If <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for all <span class="math">\(k, c \leq k &lt; n\)</span>, then
<strong>Thrm</strong> holds for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Proving either variant of the induction step (in
conjunction with verifying the base case) yields a satisfactory proof
by mathematical induction.</p>
<p>The two conditions that make up the induction proof combine to
demonstrate that <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for <span class="math">\(n=2\)</span> as an extension of the
fact that <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for <span class="math">\(n=1\)</span>.
This fact, combined again with condition (2) or (2a), indicates
that <strong>Thrm</strong> also holds for <span class="math">\(n=3\)</span>, and so on.
Thus, <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for all values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> (larger than the
base cases) once the two conditions have been proved.</p>
<p>What makes mathematical induction so powerful (and so mystifying to
most people at first) is that we can take advantage of the
<em>assumption</em> that <strong>Thrm</strong> holds for all values less
than <span class="math">\(n\)</span> as a tool to help us prove that <strong>Thrm</strong> holds
for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
This is known as the <a class="reference internal" href="Glossary.html#term-induction-hypothesis"><em class="xref std std-term ODSAterm">induction hypothesis</em></a>.
Having this assumption to work with makes the induction step
easier to prove than tackling the original theorem itself.
Being able to rely on the induction hypothesis provides extra
information that we can bring to bear on the problem.</p>
<p>Recursion and induction have many similarities.
Both are anchored on one or more base cases.
A recursive function relies on the ability to call itself to get the
answer for smaller instances of the problem.
Likewise, induction proofs rely on the truth of the induction
hypothesis to prove the theorem.
The induction hypothesis does not come out of thin air.
It is true if and only if the theorem itself is true, and
therefore is reliable within the proof context.
Using the induction hypothesis it do work is exactly the same as using
a recursive call to do work.</p>
<div class="topic" id="sumiex">
<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.3 </p>
<p>Here is a sample proof by mathematical induction.
Call the sum of the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> positive integers <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n)\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n) = n(n+1)/2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
The proof is by mathematical induction.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Check the base case.</strong>
For <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span>, verify that <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(1) = 1(1+1)/2\)</span>.
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(1)\)</span> is simply the sum of the first positive
number, which is 1.
Because <span class="math">\(1(1+1)/2 = 1\)</span>, the formula is correct for the base
case.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>State the induction hypothesis.</strong>
The induction hypothesis is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathbf{S}(n-1) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i =
\frac{(n-1)((n-1)+1)}{2} = \frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}.\]</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Use the assumption from the induction hypothesis for</strong>
<span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> <strong>to show that the result is true for</strong> <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
The induction hypothesis states that
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n-1) =  (n-1)(n)/2\)</span>,
and because <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n) = \mathbf{S}(n-1) + n\)</span>,
we can substitute for <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n-1)\)</span> to get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\sum_{i=1}^n i &amp;=&amp; \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i\right) + n
                   = \frac{(n-1)(n)}{2} + n\\
               &amp;=&amp;\frac{n^2 - n + 2n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Thus, by mathematical induction,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathbf{S}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n i = n(n+1)/2.\]</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Note carefully what took place in this example.
First we cast <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n)\)</span> in terms of a smaller occurrence
of the problem: <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n) = \mathbf{S}(n-1) + n\)</span>.
This is important because once <span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n-1)\)</span> comes into the
picture, we can  use the induction hypothesis to replace
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n-1)\)</span> with <span class="math">\((n-1)(n)/2\)</span>.
From here, it is simple algebra to prove that
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{S}(n-1) + n\)</span> equals the
right-hand side of the original theorem.</p>
<p>We can compare the induction proof of Example <a href="Proofs.html#sumiex">4.7.3</a>
with the direct proof in Example <a href="Proofs.html#sumdirect">4.7.1</a>.
Different people might think one is easier to understand than the
other, but certainly the writer of the direct proof version had
to discover an insight unique to that problem that might
not be helpful or relevant when proving other summations.</p>
<div class="topic" id="nodds">
<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.4 </p>
<p>Here is another simple proof by induction that illustrates
choosing the proper variable for induction.
We wish to prove by induction that the sum of the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
positive odd numbers is <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span>.
First we need a way to describe the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>'th odd number, which is
simply <span class="math">\(2n - 1\)</span>.
This also allows us to cast the theorem as a summation.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
<span class="math">\(\sum_{i=1}^n (2i - 1) = n^2\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
The base case of <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span> yields <span class="math">\(1 = 1^2\)</span>, which is
true.
The induction hypothesis is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2i - 1) = (n-1)^2.\]</div>
<p>We now use the induction hypothesis to show that the theorem
holds true for <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
The sum of the first <span class="math">\(n\)</span> odd numbers is simply the sum of the
first <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> odd numbers plus the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>'th odd number.
In the second line below, we will use the induction hypothesis to
replace the partial summation (shown in brackets in the first line)
with its closed-form solution.
After that, algebra takes care of the rest.</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\sum_{i=1}^n (2i - 1) &amp;=&amp; \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2i - 1) \right] + 2n - 1\\
                      &amp;=&amp; [(n-1)^2] + 2n - 1\\
                      &amp;=&amp; n^2 - 2n + 1 + 2n - 1\\
                      &amp;=&amp; n^2.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Thus, by mathematical induction,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum_{i=1}^n (2i - 1) = n^2.\]</div>
</div>

<span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}(n) = \mathbf{T}(n-1) + 1; \quad \mathbf{T}(1) = 0\)</span>
has closed-form solution <span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}(n) = n - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
To prove the base case, we observe from the definition that
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}(2) = \mathbf{T}(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\)</span>.
From the proposed closed-form solution we get
<span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}(2) = 2 - 1 = 1\)</span>, which matches the definition.</p>
<p>The induction hypothesis is that <span class="math">\(\mathbf{T}(n-1) = n-2\)</span>.
Combining the definition of the recurrence with the induction
hypothesis, we see immediately that</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathbf{T}(n) = \mathbf{T}(n-1) + 1 = n-2 + 1 = n-1\]</div>
<p>for <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>.
Thus, we have proved the theorem correct by mathematical induction.</p>

<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.6 </p>
<p>This example uses induction without involving summations or other
equations.
It also illustrates a more flexible use of base cases.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
2 cent and 5 cent stamps can be used to form any value
(for values <span class="math">\(\geq 4\)</span>).</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
The theorem defines the problem for values <span class="math">\(\geq 4\)</span>
because it does not hold for the values 1 and 3.
Using 4 as the base case, a value of 4 cents can be made from two
2 cent stamps.
The induction hypothesis is that a value of <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> can be
made from some combination of 2 cent and 5 cent stamps.
We now use the induction hypothesis to show how to get the value
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> from 2 cent and 5 cent stamps.
Either the makeup for value <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> includes a 5 cent stamp,
or it does not.
If so, then replace a 5 cent stamp with three 2 cent stamps.
If not, then the makeup must have included at least two 2 cent
stamps (because it is at least of size 4 and contains only 2 cent
stamps).
In this case, replace two of the 2 cent stamps with a single
5 cent stamp.
In either case, we now have a value of n made up of
2 cent and 5 cent stamps.
Thus, by mathematical induction, the theorem is correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.7 </p>
<p>Here is an example using strong induction.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
For <span class="math">\(n &gt; 1, n\)</span> is divisible by some prime number.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
For the base case, choose <span class="math">\(n = 2\)</span>.
2 is divisible by the prime number 2.
The induction hypothesis is that <em>any</em> value <span class="math">\(a, 2 \leq a &lt; n\)</span>,
is divisible by some prime number.
There are now two cases to consider when proving the theorem for
<span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is a prime number, then <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is divisible by itself.
If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is not a prime number, then <span class="math">\(n = a \times b\)</span>
for <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, both integers less than <span class="math">\(n\)</span> but
greater than 1.
The induction hypothesis tells us that <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is divisible by some
prime number.
That same prime number must also divide <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
Thus, by mathematical induction, the theorem is correct.</p>
</div>
<p>Our next example of mathematical induction proves a theorem from
geometry.
It also illustrates a standard technique of induction proof where we
take <span class="math">\(n\)</span> objects and remove some object to use the
induction hypothesis.</p>

<p>Compare the proof in Example <a href="Proofs.html#thmregion">4.7.8</a> with that in
Example <a href="Proofs.html#thmstamps">4.7.6</a>.
For Example <a href="Proofs.html#thmstamps">4.7.6</a>, we took a collection of stamps of
size <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> (which, by the induction hypothesis, must have the
desired property) and from that &quot;built&quot; a collection of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span>
that has the desired property.
We therefore proved the existence of <em>some</em> collection of stamps
of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> with the desired property.</p>
<p>For Example <a href="Proofs.html#thmregion">4.7.8</a> we must prove that <em>any</em>
collection of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> lines has the desired property.
Thus, our strategy is to take an <em>arbitrary</em> collection of
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> lines, and &quot;reduce&quot; it so that we have a set of lines that
must have the desired property because it matches the induction
hypothesis.
From there, we merely need to show that reversing the original
reduction process preserves the desired property.</p>
<p>In contrast, consider what is required if we attempt to
&quot;build&quot; from a set of lines of size <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> to one of size
<span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
We would have great difficulty justifying that <em>all</em> possible
collections of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> lines are covered by our building process.
By reducing from an arbitrary collection of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> lines to
something less, we avoid this problem.</p>
<p>Another advantage to thinking in terms of &quot;reducing from <span class="math">\(n\)</span>&quot;
rather than &quot;building up from <span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>&quot; is that reducing is more
like what we do when we write a recursive function.
In recursion, we would naturally compute some
function of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> by calling the function (recursively) on
<span class="math">\(n-1\)</span> and then using the result to compute the value for
<span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>This section's final example shows how induction can be used to
prove that a recursive function produces the correct result.</p>
<div class="topic">
<p class="topic-title first">Example 4.7.9 </p>
<p>We would like to prove that function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> does indeed compute
the factorial function.
There are two distinct steps to such a proof.
The first is to prove that the function always terminates.
The second is to prove that the function returns the correct value.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
Function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> will terminate for any value of <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
For the base case, we observe that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> will terminate directly
whenever <span class="math">\(n \leq 0\)</span>.
The induction hypothesis is that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> will terminate for
<span class="math">\(n-1\)</span>.
For <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, we have two possibilities.
One possibility is that <span class="math">\(n \geq 12\)</span>.
In that case, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> will terminate directly because it will
fail its assertion test.
Otherwise, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> will make a recursive call to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n-1)</span></code>.
By the induction hypothesis, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n-1)</span></code> must terminate.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong>
Function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact</span></code> does compute the factorial function for any value
in the range 0 to 12.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
To prove the base case, observe that when <span class="math">\(n=0\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(n=1\)</span>, <cite>fact(n)</cite> returns the correct value of 1.
The induction hypothesis is that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n-1)</span></code> returns the correct
value of <cite>(n-1)!</cite>.
For any value <cite>n</cite> within the legal range, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n)</span></code> returns
<span class="math">\(n *\)</span> <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n-1)</span></code>.
By the induction hypothesis, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n-1)</span></code> <span class="math">\(= (n-1)!\)</span>,
and because <span class="math">\(n * (n-1)! = n!\)</span>, we have proved that <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fact(n)</span></code>
produces the correct result.</p>
</div>
<p>We can use a similar process to prove many recursive programs correct.
The general form is to show that the base cases perform correctly, and
then to use the induction hypothesis to show that the recursive step
also produces the correct result.
Prior to this, we must prove that the function always terminates,
which might also be done using an induction proof.</p>
