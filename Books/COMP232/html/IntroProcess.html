<h2>2.3.1. Software Development Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p id="index-1">A <strong>software development process</strong> is simply the division of a software project into
distinct stages or phases of work.
Each stage is characterized by specific activities which are used to help plan and
manage progress.
A software development process is implemented to improve quality, cost or schedule
performance, or all of these things.
While there as many software development processes as there are software practitioners,
a few have gained notoriety.
These more commonly encountered processes are the ones discussed in this section.</p>
<p>All software development processes are essentially variations on the <em>Plan-Do-Check-Act</em>
first described by Francis Bacon in 1620 [Bacon].  Yes, that’s right.
There are many software development processes, describing the  <em>Plan-Do-Check-Act</em> loop
in varying levels of detail.  Today, most of these processes are lumped into either
of two very broad categories: <em>Agile</em> or <em>Plan Driven</em>.</p>
<p>Plan Driven processes emerged in the 1960's.
As the size of software projects grew, several worrying trends emerged:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Software projects routinely went over budget, or failed to deliver anything</li>
<li>Major defects and failures became more common</li>
<li>Software maintenance costs began increasing</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>At the time, there was no professional class of programmers.
Engineers, mathematicians, and physicists wrote programs to support their work.
The first software development processes were adapted from manufacturing and engineering
processes.
Among the earliest was the systems development life cycle (SLDC).
The goals of the SDLC were
&quot;to pursue the development of information systems in a very deliberate,
structured and methodical way, requiring each stage of the life cycle from
inception of the idea to delivery of the final system,
to be carried out rigidly and sequentially&quot; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[1]</a>.
Plan-driven methods continue to be the 'traditional' way most software
continues to be developed today.</p>
<p>Agile methods grew out frustration with the rigidity of the plan-driven processes commonly used
in the 1990's just as the tech boom was heating up.
Technology was changing faster than projects could keep up and many projects failed because
by the time they were ready to deliver, the playing field had changed enough to make the product,
if not obsolete, at least a less compelling commercial success.</p>
<p>The practitioners of Agile methods tend to be a diverse and fraction group, but have, as a group
drafted a single statement that nearly all agile process models embrace.
It is known as the <em>Agile Manifesto</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a>.  Here it is in it's entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Through this work we have come to value:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line"><strong>Individuals and interactions</strong> over processes and tools</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Working software</strong> over comprehensive documentation</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Customer collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation</div>
<div class="line"><strong>Responding to change</strong> over following a plan</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left <strong>more</strong>.</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Much of the documentation available today implies that choosing a process is
an <em>either - or</em> proposition.  That a project must be either plan driven or agile.
The reality is a bit more nuanced and there can can be bitter disagreements
between proponents of different process models.
One way to summarize the differences between the two groups is to examine the
myths propagated about them.</p>
<p>Common misunderstandings directed at Plan-driven processes include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Can’t respond to change</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Too big and complex</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Products cost more</li>
<li>Only for large organizations</li>
<li>Old-Fashioned</li>
<li>Universally Applicable
- Software development is uncertain and the <strong>X</strong> process improves predictability therefore all software developers should use process <strong>X</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Common misunderstandings directed at agile processes include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Agile is synonymous with Hacking</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>It’s a ‘silver bullet’</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Easy to implement, Very effective</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Do whatever you want</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>No cost or schedule commitments</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Incompatible with traditional processes</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>No Documentation, Architecture, or Planning</li>
<li>Not appropriate for Firm Fixed Price Projects</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Universally Applicable</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>The pace of IT change is accelerating and Agile methods adapt to change better than disciplined methods therefore Agile methods will take over the IT world.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is that many agile and plan-driven methods exist.
All are more or less plan-driven and some have more 'agile' characteristics than others.
Therefore, a more accurate characterisation is to think of processes
existing along a continuum, with the axis representing the relative
amount of willingness to embrace change (agility) at one and
the importance of comprehensive up front planning and adhering to that plan
at the opposite end.  No process exists at either extreme.</p>

<h3>2.3.1.1. Waterfall Method<a class="headerlink" href="#waterfall-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Initially described in 1970, the Waterfall process was another early
software development process adapted from manufacturing and construction processes.
The waterfall model is a sequential design process, in which progress is seen as
flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through several distinct phases.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/BackWaterfall.png" src="_images/BackWaterfall.png" />
<p class="caption"> Figure 2.3.3: Waterfall model <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id7">[3]</a></p>
</div>
<p>While many variations exist, most waterfall processes in use go through at least
the following phases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Requirements: System and software requirements, captured in a product requirements document.</li>
<li>Analysis: resulting in models, schema, and business rules</li>
<li>Design: resulting in the software architecture</li>
<li>Implementation: the development and integration of software</li>
<li>Verification: the systematic discovery and debugging of defects</li>
<li>Maintenance: the installation, migration, support, and maintenance of complete systems</li>
</ol>
<p>The waterfall model was simple to understand and was widely used throughout the 1980's,
but came under criticism primarily for it's lack of flexibility.
Although officially endorsed bu the US Department of Defense in 1985, the DoD supplanted
it with other process guidance 10 years later.</p>

<h3>2.3.1.2. Rational Unified Process<a class="headerlink" href="#rational-unified-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Unified Software Development Process or Unified Process is a popular iterative
and incremental software development process framework.
The best-known and extensively documented refinement of the Unified Process is the
Rational Unified Process (RUP).
Other examples are OpenUP and Agile Unified Process.</p>
<p>The Rational Unified Process (RUP) was created by the Rational Software Corporation in 1996.
RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process framework,
intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that
will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs.</p>
<p>RUP is based on a set of building blocks and content elements,
describing what is to be produced, the necessary skills required and
the step-by-step explanation describing how specific development goals are to be achieved.
The main building blocks, or content elements, are the following:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Roles (who)</strong></dt>
<dd>A role defines a set of related skills, competencies and responsibilities.</dd>
<dt><strong>Work products (what)</strong></dt>
<dd>A work product represents something resulting from a task,
including all the documents and models produced while working through the process.</dd>
<dt><strong>Tasks (how)</strong></dt>
<dd>A task describes a unit of work assigned to a Role that provides a meaningful result.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/BackRUPIterations.png" src="_images/BackRUPIterations.png" />
<p class="caption"> Figure 2.3.4: RUP disciplines and iterations</p>
</div>
<p>The RUP defines a project as a series of <em>iterations</em>.
An iteration is a period of time in which project tasks are performed.
Within each iteration, the tasks are categorized into nine disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Six &quot;engineering&quot; disciplines</p>
<blockquote>

<h3>2.3.1.3. eXtreme Programming (XP)<a class="headerlink" href="#extreme-programming-xp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Established in the late 1990's by Kent Beck, XP is
regarded as perhaps the most famous agile method.
XP was certainly among the first to gain attention from mainstream
software development projects.
XP was refined from experience gained developing an information system for Daimler Chrysler
corporation.
As agile practices go, it is quite proscriptive, fairly rigorous and
initially expects all practices to be followed.
Kent Beck has been quoted as saying</p>
<blockquote>
<div>If you're not performing all 12 practices, then you're not doing XP.</div></blockquote>
<p>In <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em>, Kent Beck describes extreme programming as a
software development discipline that organizes people to produce higher quality
software more productively.
XP attempts to reduce the cost of changes in requirements by having multiple
short development cycles, rather than a long one.
Rather than a burden, changes are considered a natural, inescapable and desirable aspect of
software projects, and should be planned for, instead of attempting
to define a stable set of requirements.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img alt="_images/Extreme_Programming.png" src="_images/Extreme_Programming.png" />
<p class="caption"> Figure 2.3.5: Planning and feedback loops in extreme programming. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id9">[4]</a></p>
</div>
<p>XP is characterised by several core practices including
stories, pair programming, simple design,
test first, unit tests, and continuous integration.</p>
<p>The XP process describes four basic activities that are performed
within the software development process:
coding, testing, listening, and designing.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Coding</dt>
<dd><p class="first">XP argues that the only truly important product of the software
development process is code – software instructions that a computer can interpret.
Without code, there is no working product.</p>
<p class="last">Coding can also be used to figure out the most suitable solution.
Coding can also help to communicate thoughts about programming problems.
Programmers dealing with a complex programming problem, or finding it hard to
explain the solution to fellow programmers, might code it in a simplified manner
and use the code to demonstrate what they mean.
Code, say the proponents of this position, is always clear and concise
and cannot be interpreted in more than one way.
Other programmers can give feedback on this code by also coding their thoughts.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Testing</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Unit tests determine whether a given feature works as intended.
A programmer writes as many automated tests as they can think of that might &quot;break&quot; the code;
if all tests run successfully, then the coding is complete.
Every piece of code that is written is tested before moving on to the next feature.</p>
<p>Acceptance tests verify that the requirements as understood by the programmers
satisfy the customer's actual requirements.</p>
<p class="last">System-wide integration testing was encouraged, initially,
as a daily end-of-day activity, for early detection of incompatible interfaces,
to reconnect before the separate sections diverged widely from coherent functionality.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Listening</dt>
<dd>Programmers must listen to what the customers need the system to do,
what &quot;business logic&quot; is needed.
They must understand these needs well enough to give the customer feedback
about the technical aspects of how the problem might be solved, or cannot be solved.
Communication between the customer and programmer is further addressed in the planning game.</dd>
<dt>Designing</dt>
<dd>As software systems grow, the importance of design increases.
Small programs can be constructed with comparatively little design,
however as software size grows, the more design is required.
Often more upfront design is required as well as checking and revisiting
designs throughout the lifetime of the project.</dd>

<h3>2.3.1.4. Crystal<a class="headerlink" href="#crystal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Established in the late 1990's by Alistair Cockburn, Crystal is
conceived as a family of software development processes organized by color,
clear, yellow, orange, red.
To date, only Crystal Clear, the most light-weight in the family, has been completely documented.</p>
<p>Crystal provides different levels of “ceremony” depending on the size of the team and the
criticality of the project.
Crystal practices draw from agile and plan-driven methods as well as psychology
and organizational development research.</p>

<h3>2.3.1.5. Scrum<a class="headerlink" href="#scrum" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Scrum is an agile software management process.
That is, it describes how software development teams should be organised and
let's each team determine what technical software development activities they
should perform.</p>
<p>Projects are divided into 30-day work intervals (“sprints”) in which a
specific number of requirements from a prioritized list (“backlog”) are implemented.
Short (10-15 minute) “Scrum meetings”, held daily, maintain coordination within the team and with
project stakeholders (pigs and chickens).</p>

<h3>2.3.1.6. Feature-Driven Development (FDD)<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-driven-development-fdd" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>FDD is a lightweight, architecturally based process that initially establishes
an overall object architecture and features list.
Projects then proceed to design-by-feature and build-by-feature activities.
Both design-by-feature and build-by-feature are incremental software
construction methodologies.
In FDD, the use of UML or other object-oriented design methods is strongly implied,
if not explicitly required.</p>
